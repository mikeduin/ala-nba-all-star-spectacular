The NBA All-Star Spectacular is the second original, custom-built pool game from A Level Above and is believed to be the world's first NBA All-Star Weekend pool. Built with a Node, Express, and PostgreSQL backend, jQuery for user behavior, Facebook OAuth for authentication, and Pug/Jade server-side templating.
