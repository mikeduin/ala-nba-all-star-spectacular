            | - $20 buy-in payayble via Venmo to @mikeduin or CashApp/GooglePay to michael.s.duin@gmail.com. Number of places paid will depend on number of entrants. 
          li
            b
              | - Each entrant has $1,000 in fake dollars to spread out on bets over NBA All-Star Weekend. 
          li
            | - Each entrant MUST wager at least $100 on each of the three All-Star Saturday Night events (Skills Challenge, Three-Point Contest, and Dunk Contest) and the All-Star Game. This rule is in place to avoid an entrant winning the pool by placing a single $1,000 bet on something; having a stake in the majority of the weekend's events is the idea here (there is no bet requirement for the Rising Stars game).
          li
            | - The bets to meet the $100 minimums can be of any type (e.g., your All-Star Game bet(s) could be on the MVP or the point spread) and can consist of one or multiple bets (e.g., you could bet $40 on three different players to win the three-point contest). The $100 minimums are tracked for you on the 
            a(href=`/picks/${year}`).
              picks page.
          li
            | - Beyond that, the rest of your bankroll can be spread out however you'd like.
          li
            | - Rising Stars lines lock at 6 PM PST on Friday, 2/17. The rest of your picks -- both for the All-Star Saturday Night events and for Sunday's All-Star Game -- are due by 5 PM PST on Saturday, 2/18.
